# Revolution Grazing

## The Problem:

Over-grazing of fields can cause the detereioration of fields.
In wet areas, over-grazing can lead to mud pits. In dry areas,
it can lead to catostrophic events like the [dust bowl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dust_Bowl).
For sustainable agriculture, rotaional grazing is a key
strategy that farmers use to care for their land.

## The Solution

The USDA provides a program that helps farmers manage the rotation
oof animals, but we created an android app that will calculate and
track when a farmer needs to rotate fields.
